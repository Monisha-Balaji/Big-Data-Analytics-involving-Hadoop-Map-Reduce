patricia highsmith adaptation couple week quite refreshing switch little gem george simenon adaptation the blue room star mathieu almaric directs film the film minute long none time wasted julien mathieu almaric owner business selling renting agricultural equipment central france he attractive modern house beautiful wife child met girl desired school she helping run pharmacy nearby town older husband ailing she much affair couple meet afternoon together local hotel blue room becomes regular site passion the film presented sequence short scene ellipsis it reminded somehow chris marker la jetée france narrative made still image the story narrated via flashback julien memory questioning local examining magistrate prison psychologist crime committed finally court scene traditional small town courtroom local crammed witness event much interest film formal precision the aspect ratio academy almaric explains reason film press note this choice seems becoming common for worked chamber film clear sense entrapment squarish enclosed screen space seemed appropriate almaric say panoramic feel widescreen would created something different the two factor use carefully chosen musical scoring grégoire hetzel photography depends many quite static shot composed christophe beaucarne real body this kind film defeat conventional perspective i seen described erotic thriller imdb list various classification different territory in u mpaa r presumably nudity graphic nudity in uk bbfc in germany france tous public the film directly erotic nudity i sure thriller either although one scene might make jump what transgressive nude body presented realist way it hot day sex made lover sweat may semen certainly drama spot blood dropped white towel lip bitten heat passion any eroticism really mind thrill secrecy affair woman open desire man acquiescence esther played stéphanie cléau also credited film she physically taller julien also confident assured i think type even though learn little know come julien memory i say u review refer similar hollywood genre movie i think work quite differently stéphanie cléau film actor her experience theatre writer indeed something compellingly different brave performance almaric say since julien wife delphine played actor léa drucker important esther known face would contest two actor esther initiator way affair move julien way willing victim all three lead excellent julien wife delphine daughter suzanne holiday on one level story affair destroy marriage mapped clinical investigation magistrate psychologist prison on second level cinephile treat delirious mix influence connection simenon novel come early familiar story honed many year he adapted many time amalric tell acquired right time gap project chance make chamber piece short time the obvious lineage idea film simenon chabrol via hitchcock there sense bourgeois affair especially france rather thriller though like mystery whydunit we get strong clue one crime might committed sure another might happened even julien would stray wife child in memorable line film julien reflects life different live go back the trailer offer good sense formal quality film i struck power music suggest perhaps question emotion amongst string influence preminger fritz lang almaric hetzel created blend hitchcock bernard herrmann truffaut use george delerue la femme à côté this film watch in uk film handful cinema picturehouses claim provided one busiest discovery tuesday audience also available vod the film trailer correct ratio u trailer falsely represent film the italian poster film this extraordinary film adaptation patricia highsmith third novel the blunderer published the price salt later became carol the talented ripley the french title mean the murderer i also shown english italian german title post a far i see film follows novel fairly closely shifting action area around nice region france keeping name character i confess i quite surprised behaviour character film indeed based highsmith character i surprised the film narrative actually recognisably highsmith presentation definitely odd walter maurice ronet music student ellie marina vlady in outline familiar highsmith model two men linked strange way involving murder female character mainly functional rather active the wonderfully named melchior kimmel bookseller one night murder wife arranging alibi an architect walter saccard trapped feel painful marriage chasing young music student he read murder kimmel wife nice matin decides visit bookshop later investigates kimmel alibi set motion extraordinary incident tie two men together the third crucial male figure narrative deranged police detective corbi like i rarely seen highsmith certainly police procedurals i spoil narrative want read novel the german poster emphasising kimmel thick glass common france early especially italy germany in french production listed french film industry european cinema ed ginette vincendeau in case presumably factor casting gert froebe kimmel others audience expressed view froebe dubbed swears german several time yvonne furneaux oxford worked uk film industry also dubbed saccard wife clara my poor ear french distinguish case much dialogue seemed shouted anyway the important production issue really example françois truffaut famously dismissed le cinéma de papa le meurtrier scripted team jean aurenche pierre bost truffaut main villain directed claude director put category truffaut alone most critic cahiers du cinéma loathed director like jacques rivette i think clément clouzot sickening people corrupted quoted cahiers du cinéma the ed jim hillier bfi rivette arguing others simply interested making money would refuse work street like rossellini making social film this perspective need placed carefully context like much cahiers polemic many issue aware truffaut charge cinema old men attached literary source relied tight script studio set peddled form entertainment little artistic expression truffaut used similar kind literary text early career ranging literary novel série noire thriller true cinematic auteur alfred hitchcock already adapted patricia highsmith stranger train by le meurtrier appeared truffaut charge lost much impact following rené clément highsmith adaptation plein soleil released clément another old guard version the talented ripley glorious colour great nino rota score camerawork henri decaë photographed truffaut blow outstanding performance young alain delon maurice ronet in fact claimed highsmith favourite adaptation work died seeing today plein soleil look fresh youthful exciting anything la nouvelle vague but true le meurtrier walter maurice ronet wife clara yvonne furneaux much le meurtrier shot location around nice scene feel modern interior shot victorine studio nice aspect feel quite the reality collaborator indeed old men seen truffaut the director nearing writer roughly age older many others creative team born this make poor filmmaker help explain part animosity young critic wanted young filmmaker two bit trivia may may interesting the shoot included two couple marina vlady play ellie music student married young robert hossein play deranged detective they already split later vlady would become known central character godard two three thing i know about her france yvonne furneaux married director photography film jacques watteau shoot maurice ronet real star film seems happy appear film old guard new wave filmmaker interrogation detective corbi robert hossein kimmel gert froebe ronet behind left far background harry meyen toni witness i think background necessarily explains film feel odd help i certainly entertained film even i found scene quite poorly executed highsmith narrative often dependent unexpected behaviour character coincidence accident might expected melodrama in adaptation acceptable perhaps hardly noticed performance maintenance tone accommodates violence black comedy i sure case le meurtrier sometimes impossible suspend disbelief who might asked the blunderer title it could conceivably three leading male character kimmel overweight shortsighted glass remind u stranger train saccard lie badly make string mistake talk detective detective extraordinary the music score interpreted attempt kind scoring used hitchcock especially herrmann i think worked made difficult work kind film i understand keith withall going write something overall technical aspect print season in case warned dcp created worn print might expect scratch these turned minor there two

der essay von annett meiritz und ihre darin geschilderten erfahrungen bei der berichterstattung über die piratenpartei haben un sehr betroffen gemacht wir distanzieren un von der verhaltensweise von einigen unserer mitglieder verurteilen die ausdrucksweise und da verhalten einiger piraten der berliner landesvorstand hat einem im artikel beschriebenen mitglied wegen seiner beleidigungen bereits eine ordnungsmaßnahme ausgesprochen e ist gut das annett meiritz ihre erfahrungen al journalistin unseren reihen öffentlich macht ihr artikel enthält einige beispiele dafür das unserer partei der anspruch über diskriminierung hinausgewachsen zu sein nicht eingelöst wird dieser realität müssen wir un stellen wir der vorstand der berliner piratinnen und die unterzeichnerinnen distanzieren un davon negative kritische artikel al diffamierung abzutun und plädieren für eine eine sachliche auseinandersetzung mit der vorgebrachten kritik wir bitten annett meiritz um verzeihung und danken ihr für den weckruf den sie bei vielen von un ausgelöst hat ihr artikel verdeutlicht das e ein mehr sensibilisierung für den latenten zum teil unterschwelligen und auch offenen sexismus der piratenpartei braucht un ist bewusst das wir diese sensibilisierung nicht einfach verordnen sondern sie selbst leben müssen annett meiritz schreibt sie renne nicht bei jedem dummen spruch zur antidiskriminierungsstelle sie wolle auch kein aseptisches arbeitsklima da wollen wir auch nicht journalistinnen wie mitglieder müssen ihrer arbeit ungehindert und frei von diskrimierung und diffamierung nachgehen können wir wissen das e viele piratinnen gibt die sachen sexismus und außerhalb der partei sehr aufmerksam und engagiert sind und für die zur politischen aktion auch eine persönliche eine menschliche entwicklung gehört dy wollen wir stärken e steht für un außer frage das alle piratinnen mithelfen müssen damit die piratenpartei einmal mit fug und recht von sich behaupten kann geschlechterdiskriminierung die gibt e bei un nicht für den vorstand gerhard anger gordon thomas manuel schneider frank thiesen stephan bliedung gero nagel benjamin meyer für da pressesquad ben de biel ursula konstanze dobberke enno lenze björn glienke maria rosenau ich zeichne mal mit und begrüße diesen schritt unseres lvs zur antidiskriminierungsstelle mus sie ja auch nicht im haut da ganze noch viel mehr rein der umgang mit ihr al journalistin ist zu verurteilen und sicherlich besteht auch ein interesse der öffentlichkeit dem geschehen positiv war dem artikel auch das ebenfalls andere parteien ihr fett wegbekommen haben dennoch e wird sich nicht mit unserer kommunikationsweise auseinandergesetzt damit das bei un alles öffentlich und derber ist war e im schon immer e wird sich mit den worten ohne den zugehörigen kontext auseinandergesetzt e erinnert die debatte um die kleine hexe e ist richtig aufzuzeigen das sexismus dieser partei existiert e ist erschütternd welchem ausmaß allerdings kann ich nicht verstehen warum sie dann mit alteingesessenen tisch über frauenfeindliche witze lachen kann ohne darüber einen artikel zu schreiben daher vermute ich das derjenige pirat der anette meiritz beleidigte auf ihren schreibstil im umgang mit der partei anspielte wie verblendet bist du denn weil sie eine frau ist ist e oaky das mann sie aufgrund ihres schreibstils al nutte abstempelt deinen kommentar hättest du dir sparen können aber verklemmte chauvinisten deiner sorte entblöden sich halt ungern leider weiß ich au beobachtungen vom zuhören und au schriftlichen quellen das sich bei einer vielzahl von piraten eine aversion gegenüber der presse aufgestaut hat die ich sonst lediglich bei der npd und anderen rechtsradikalen vermutet habe du passt ja hervorragend in raster schäme dich wie verblendet bist du denn weil sie eine frau ist ist e oaky das mann sie aufgrund ihres schreibstils al nutte abstempelt du bitte nochmal zitieren welcher zeile ich auch nur irgendeine beleidigung al okay befinde anyways worauf ich anspiele ist folgendes da da wort gern und oft falsch al metapher für jede art von erkaufter abhängigkeit gebraucht wird http die frage die sich mich nun stellt wäre e sexistisch gewesen wenn ein männlicher journalist al prostituierter bezeichnet worden wäre wäre da männerfeindlich oder sogar frauenfeindlich das e sich nichtsdestotrotz um eine üble und vermutlich sexistische beleidigung handelt ist unbestritten ich kenne jedoch simon lange zu wenig um mir anzumaßen sagen zu können für ein bild dieser mensch von frau hat wa ich eigentlich sagen e gibt wesentlich eindeutigere fälle von sexismus dieser partei und die sind weiterhin aufzuzeigen aber da jetzt eine journalisten betroffen ist ist e natürlich angebracht das sich der vorstand berlin für einen kruden typen entschuldigt der sowieso die ganze zeit alle möglichen leute aufs übelste beschimpft probleme werden hiermit nicht doch gelöst da ganze ist nur ein schuldeingeständnis ich persönlich hätte mir da eher ein zwischen simon lange und annette meiritz gewünscht da hätten wir sicher mehr über un selbst unsere gesellschaft und die wechselwirkungen zwischen politik und medien gelernt al einer artikelschlacht vielleicht hätte sich dann auch geklärt warum der typ ihr etwas in gesicht hätte nicht sagen können oder warum man schon früher ein pav hätte beantragen sollen da ich gegen die presse hab stimmt im allgemeinen nicht ich bin froh die presse ist nicht ohne grund die vierte gewalt ich habe jedoch etwas gegen stimmungsmache und schlechte recherche um dich zu beruhigen mich stört e auch wie die presse gegen die fdp spd oder wulff hetzt wenn du meinst alle vorwürfe gegen die piraten wären gerechtfertigt bitte p ach und bist du da http dann denke ich nämlich du bist hier der wahre sexist hi marcel dennoch e wird sich nicht mit unserer kommunikationsweise auseinandergesetzt damit das bei un alles öffentlich und derber ist war e im

sommige gebeurtenissen zijn zo surrealistisch dat het moeilijk te geloven dat ze echt plaatsvinden lee en huiver gisteren verscheen ene arjan voor de rechtbank zwolle hij jaar en al sociotherapeut werkzaam hopen en veronderstellen wás werkzaam bij hoeve boschoord een forensisch psychiatrische kliniek drenthe er worden onder andere zedendelinquenten behandeld het heeft er alle schijn van boschoord met arjan de kat op het spek heeft gebonden hoeve boschoord stond sind eind onder verscherpt toezicht van de inspectie van gezondheidszorg inmiddels dat niet meer zo via een kwam deze arjan contact met het toen meisje dat resulteerde kinderporno honderden video en foto werden met derden gedeeld regelmatig met de uitnodiging om met dit meisje seks te hebben zo n uitnodiging werd notabene

verkrachting hanteren het wordt hoogtijd dat ons rechtssysteem aanranding verkrachting het misbruik en de exploitatie van vrouwen een heel andere categorie plaatst al je het wilt voorkomen tenminste

strip club while u heard taxi driver getting little something strip club encouraging passenger go certain club people aware club willing generous casino marketing executive steer casino customer club generosity run customer expenditure oddly enough nothing illegal paying someone steer business strip club long properly disclosed permitted within regulatory guideline ethically morally challenging yes illegal to avoid harassment claim though executive involved avoid asking directing staff member make arrangement in case though casino i would ripping executive taking casino guest somewhere else spend time money i would much rather spent casino massage while street la vega often littered flyer handout free magazine featuring entertainer massage casino host frequently asked guest arrange massage some request quite legitimate basically make type request casino host equivalent pandering probably illegal in past fired accepted resignation casino host caught action i much sympathy expect casino stimulated ngcb curb behavior though harassment traditional sense certainly lends environment blur line line clearly defined hostess club though well known throughout asia hostess club commonly

however regulator going become moralistic sexual harassment exploitation would follow take exception form customer entertainment i suspect though hostess club form entertainment usually reserved customer regulator try avoid addressing topic altogether casino marketing executive using hostess club start burying activity deeper getting receipt club banquet expensive dinner party rather actual service provided surprisingly gaming company risk sexual harassment probably le use hostess club management requires marketing staff take customer club staff could claim form harassment while really

verhandlungen im rahmen de zentralverbands der deutschen werbewirtschaft um piratenseiten wie den werbegeldhahn zuzudrehen geplant ist zu folge eine beschwerdestelle und eine schwarze liste mit strukturell urheberrechtsverletztenden website mey zu folge soll da bündnis kürze den start gehen bereits heute seien aber blacklist im einsatz wie mey nach einem gespräch mit einem vertreter der bamberger upjers gmbh berichtet mit sämtlichen werbepartnern würden vorab vereinbarungen getroffen die da schalten von werbung auf illegalen seiten ausdrücklich verbieten und verstöße mit empfindlichen vertragsstrafen ahnden zudem enthalte die vereinbarung auch eine blacklist auf der unter anderem die seite für den digitale gesellschaft hat mey auch mich um eine stellungnahme gebeten der verein digitale gesellschaft äußert sich im gespräch mit hyperland grundsätzlich positiv zu dem vorhaben kritisch sei jedoch das ein vager begriff wie strukturell urheberrechtsverletzend auch ausgelegt werden könne das er neue und innovative dienstleister behindert meint leonhard dobusch strategien der rechtsdurchsetzung die nicht auf abmahnung von endnutzern sondern auf eine verfolgung gewerbsmäßiger urheberrechtsverletzer setzen sind aber zu begrüßten sagt dobusch und tatsächlich sind derartige formen privater rechtsdurchsetzung nicht vorbehaltlos zu begrüßen vor allem wegen de fehlenden rechtswegs und mangelnder transparenz verbindung mit unscharfen begriffen ein schwammiger begriff wie strukturell urheberrechtsverletzende webseiten kann beispielsweise je nach auslegung auch innovative neue dienstleistungen treffen youtube war zu beginn bzw vor entwicklung de auch ein strukturell urheberechtsverletzendes portal bzw ist e nach ansicht der gema wohl immer noch dennoch hat sich gezeigt das gerade via youtube einem ebenfalls nicht unproblematischen ansatz auch neue monetarisierungsmöglichkeiten entstanden sind an einer reform de urheberrechts führt deshalb weiterhin kein weg vorbei sind doch streng genommen auch plattformen wie facebook derzeit strukturell über den die autorin wirtschaftsminister peter altmaier den teufel mit dem beelzebub austreiben youtube hält den brand von notre dame für einen terroranschlag und google verliert vor gericht gegen deutsche verbraucherschützer und wie breitet sich eigentlich rechte desinformation im netz au und wie gefährlich ist da die interessantesten reste de tages nach der ist vor der nationalen urheberrechtsdebatte in den fokus rücken dabei da recht auf freie benutzung und da zitatrecht und die mit spannung erwartete entscheidung im um zwei sekunden de metall auf metall die umstrittende kommt mit der abstimmung im nahm sie heute die letzte hürde die bundesregierung laut einer protokollerklärung uploadfilter weitgehend unnötig machen doch dabei handelt e sich bloß um eine vage absichtserklärung blöde zustimmeritis wenn zu begrüßen ist das nicht mit kanonen auf endnutzer geschossen wird könntest du doch genau da begrüßen und nicht gleich den gesamten absurden ansatz das komplette plattformen auf denen nach beliebigen maßstäben und letztlich unbekannten verantwortlichen womöglich strukturell urheberrechtsverletzende mashups stattfinden nicht notwendigerweise von dort au unternommen werden ohne rechtsgrundlage von ihrem einkommen abgeschnitten werden menno privatisierung von recht sollte man keinem fall gut finden und sich auch nicht grundsätzlich positiv äussern so gut ich eure inhaltliche kritik verstehe und teile wieso man ein solche vorgehen auch nur irgendwie gut finden sollte verstehe ich nicht schon gar nicht wenn man sich damit vor den karren der gvu spannen lässt ich mus wirklich sagen euer statement dem artikel hat bei mir einiges verwunderung ausgelöst privat polizei welche wirtschaftliche bestrafung exerziert echte charme offensive daran ist nichts aber auch gar nichts zu begrüßen np vielleicht sollte man klarstellen das hier ein einzelner satz au dem zusammenhang gerissen und damit sinnentstellend zitiert wurde anders kann ich mir da nicht erklären genau deshalb habe ich da hier verbloggt noch einmal kurz und deutlich gut ist sich auf gewerbsmäßige urheberrechtsverletzer und nicht auf endnutzer zu konzentrieren bei der rechtsdurchsetzung schlecht ist sowohl private rechtsdurchsetzung al auch bzw insb mit schwammigen die frage ist ob man sich überhaupt interviewtechnisch mit dem teufel einlassen sollte allein den begriff de gewerbsmässigen urheberrechtsverletzers würde ich nicht mit meinem namen assoziiert wissen wollen da geht die richtung ob man der jungen freiheit ein interview geben darf dann hoffe ich doch ihr bittet den autor de um eine korrektur ob der satz au dem zusammenhang gerissen wurde oder nicht er bleibt wie

conflict what constitutes terrorism it often argued terrorism difficult define objectively identify matter hopelessly confused semantic ideological issue terrorism eye beholder one man terrorism another man freedom fighter like this argument however mistaken there generally accepted objective definition terrorism though minor variation deliberate attack whether government group noncombatant sometimes described innocent civilian well crucial economic societal institution infrastructure aimed reaching political religious ideological goal this definition seek resolve crucially important issue building answer definition whether form terrorism equally morally indefensible moreover unhelpful moral analysis well policy prescription definition terrorism confined mean action nonstate actor

judged term practical consequence in circumstance view hold consequence terrorism might morally preferable status quo changed except terrorism most writer terrorism certainly western political leader claim categorically oppose regardless consequence that clearly case however hypocrisy simple moral blindness often trumped categorical rejection terrorism for example cold war united state actively supported latin american military dictatorship routinely tortured murdered thousand people name anticommunism likewise little government criticism algerian military dictatorship used extensive terrorist method defeat islamic terrorist movement one point verge victory democratic election in short one reason another distinction quite common made government political reason at least general discourse often held form terrorism understandable vague euphemism essentially meaning le wrong others thus seems fair conclude ordinary judgment people truly believe form terrorism equally always prohibited in real life distinct moral theory make distinction consider mitigating circumstance cause context exception consequence typically taken account inform final moral judgment terrorism the common distinction terrorism behalf think cause behalf unjust one aside government ordinary citizen number consequentialist moral philosopher also questioned whether terrorism categorically rejected especially case extreme injustice measure remediation a well commonly observed absolute prohibition terrorism favor militarily strong obvious issue conflict examined for reason coady put many contemporary moral philosopher sympathetic thinking wary moral absolute they would test prohibition expressing strong moral presumption allow exception extreme circumstance the moral dilemma seems inescapable on one hand deliberate attack noncombatant clear moral evil on instinctively wish make distinction lesser greater evil unmitigated mitigated evil for accept truly categorical moral prohibition terrorism theory point number morally relevant distinction just cause the first distinction terrorism whose purpose morally indefensible whose purpose justified but constitutes cause one morally right fair it matter argument judgment that said international law common morality cause clearly may warrant use force attain the almost universally accepted justification beyond increasing acceptance principle force may justified protect massive abuse in light principal argument i making context conflict palestinian right cause freedom independence end israeli occupation repression however cause obviously necessary condition violence general terrorism particular ever considered justifiable least mitigable mean sufficient moral philosophy condition must met last resort absence

meeting criterion last resort absence alternative in legitimate quest independence political sovereignty mention dignity palestinian tried armed resistance israeli occupying force negotiation diplomacy nonviolent political action none worked the israeli mitigating justification they repeatedly refused agree increasingly obtainable political compromise palestinian a final reason israeli terrorism worse palestinian terrorism israel democracy however flawed when repeatedly elect prime minister worst israeli terrorist yitzhak shamir menachem begin ariel sharon people bear far greater moral responsibility crime government palestinian gaza live autocratic rule hamas indeed number israeli poll shown israeli demand government even greater violent repression palestinian oppose even innocent civilian accurately noncombatant israeli people still subject legitimate attack however surely le innocent palestinian all said argument construed defense palestinian terrorism in final

placed official one considers unjust oppressive government planting bomb tea shop killing random collection common citizen including child while act raise serious moral issue issue identical running together heading terrorism likely hamper rather help discerning moral assessment narrow definition revisionary unlike discussed next section implausibly they focus trait terrorism cause u view practice deep moral repugnance violence ii alternatively innocent people sake iii intimidation definition iv coercion in highlighting ii relate issue terrorism ethic war one fundamental principle war theory immunity they help distinguish terrorism act war proper political assassination target common citizen it matter much whether victim terrorism described innocent people term used technical sense refer lost immunity lethal extreme violence directly involved highly responsible terrorist consider insufferable injustice oppression in war innocent civilian violent conflict fall short war common citizen is injustice oppression issue thus standing implicated determined objective criterion point view resort violence coady chooses former option he approach terrorism standpoint war theory principle noncombatant immunity combatant technical term designating agent aggression broadly dangerous wrongdoer agent harm legitimate target potentially lethal violence all others noncombatant enjoy immunity violence coady this approach may difficult apply war wrong harm issue either aggression need repelled systematic violation human right provide ground humanitarian intervention issue injustice oppression arise internal conflict fall short war however tend highly contentious consider imperfect basically morally legitimate political social order others may see epitome injustice oppression must overthrown need violence under circumstance highly placed political official killed insurgent may characterized condemned many act terrorism insurgent sympathetic struggle may reject characterization portray justify killing political assassination in order avoid kind relativism primoratz put forward view one important respect take board standpoint terrorist the direct victim terrorism innocent sense responsible credible understanding responsibility liability injustice oppression terrorist fight responsible least responsible degree make liable killed maimed account the injustice oppression issue need real may merely alleged terrorist being responsible merely alleged great injustice oppression enough losing one immunity violence far type immunity innocence relevant defining terrorism concerned according mainstream war theory one lose immunity act war fighting unjust war fighting war walzer similarly one lose immunity political violence holding office implementing policy gravely unjust government holding office implementing policy government king umberto i italy said surviving assassination attempt risk come job member two class considered innocent morally protected violence attacking latter view act act war proper political assassination respectively if terrorist subscribe credible view responsibility liability attack common citizen attack people innocent point view innocent even grant terrorist assessment policy issue this say consider government gravely unjust moral license kill official terrorism rather political assassination we still condemn action reject judgment policy issue accept judgment believe opposed policy nonviolent mean but condemning action qua terrorism on account real also merely alleged injustice oppression count determining innocence victim deciding act act terrorism thus decision hostage endless debate moral status contested policy nevertheless residue relativity remains the account presupposes certain understanding responsibility liability person responsible state affair virtue person voluntary informed free act omission sufficiently strong connection state affair thereby becomes liable proportionately unfavorable response provided terrorist accept understanding responsibility liability kill maim people must admit innocent to sure militant organization resort violence perceive terrorist yet object label they profess view responsibility liability based extremely connection state affair human choice action argue entire social class nation responsible certain policy practice member liable attacked deadly violence see such argument regarded preposterous we insist viewing action terrorist although reject description it clear residue relativity could removed primoratz some object defining terrorism violence innocent person they argue run together question nature terrorism moral status begs moral issue making terrorism unjustified definition we rather keep question separate take care prejudge latter giving wrong answer former what needed morally neutral definition terrorism mean wide one corlett young but doubtful terrorism defined morally untainted way the wide definition philosopher adopt contain word violence morally loaded a narrow definition completely morally neutral violence innocent clearly morally wrong but clear violence prima facie wrong the definition implies general presumption terrorism sweeping moral condemnation every instance whatever circumstance whatever consequence desisting the definition rule certain circumstance might wrong thing considered ethical investigation preempted particular case terrorism still need judged merit another way settling issue wide narrow definition offered georg meggle he adopts wide definition terrorism go distinguish two different type terrorism strong sense deliberately recklessly negligently harm innocent people terrorism weak sense obviously moral assessment two type terrorism going significantly different meggle the vast majority case almost anyone without ax grind would want classify terrorism exhibit two trait implied ordinary use highlighted mainstream philosophical definition quoted violence intimidation but philosophical literature also offer definition leave one core component some seek sever connection terrorism violence carl wellman defines terrorism use attempted use terror mean coercion terrorism often associated violence violence effective mean intimidation yet violence essential terrorism fact act terrorism nonviolent wellman the last claim seems false interpretation there may many act generally considered terrorist involve actual violence meant intimidate threatening enough support notion terrorism seems odd so wellman example classroom terrorism professor threatens fail student submit essay due date cause panic class thereby engages terrorism robert goodin offer similar account emphasizing political role terrorism terrorism political tactic involving deliberate frightening people political advantage goodin this claim distinctive wrong terrorist commit whereas wellman account one commit act terrorism without either engaging threatening violence merely making threat order intimidate goodin account one need even make threat one act terrorist merely issuing warning act others meant intimidate this seems arbitrary although make sense step argument meant show insofar western political leader intending frighten people political advantage extent committing core wrong distinctively associated terrorism goodin it also suggested terrorism need understood inducing terror fear according ted honderich terrorism best defined violence short war political illegal prima facie wrong honderich this definition might thought problematic several count idea terrorism without terror seems especially odd the two connected etymologically historically connection deeply entrenched current ordinary use intimidation morally salient trait terrorism pace goodin one core trait cause u condemn practice we might consider severing connection honderich offered good reason but support highly revisionary definition puzzling claim define terrorism violence meant intimidate imply terrorism particularly abhorrent thereby effect invite kind prima facie approval tolerance war honderich can terrorism morally justified there single answer question single conception terrorism if put aside definition depart much compelling reason core meaning terrorism cited still need decide whether question assumes wide narrow understanding terrorism a narrow conception terrorism seems better suited ethical investigation moreover philosopher work wide definition typically hold terrorism target innocent person much difficult justify selective terrorism attack plausibly claim innocence injustice oppression issue accordingly count terrorism narrow definition term the present discussion therefore focus terrorism understood violence innocent civilian common citizen intended intimidate thereby achieve political objective broadly coerce one might try justify act campaign violence kind two way one could argue victim may common citizen nevertheless innocent wrong terrorist fighting alternatively one could concede innocence victim argue attack nevertheless justified either consequence balance deontological consideration if former line argument successful prove much in showing instance violence justified targeted really innocent shown act campaign violence issue actually case terrorism this may merely matter semantics there much damaging objection a terrorist act characteristically killing injuring random collection people happen certain place certain time argument effect people innocent wrong terrorist fight therefore wide reach accordingly based simplistic conception collective responsibility these argument sort offered example century anarchist emile henry he planted bomb office mining company exploded would killed injured number people work company lived building he also planted bomb café go injuring twenty people one later died injury at trial henry explained what innocent victim the building carmeaux company office inhabited bourgeois hence would innocent victim the whole bourgeoisie life exploitation unfortunate expiate crime together henry when commenting second attack said this utterly implausible view responsibility liability it claim member social woman young old adult liable killed maimed operating system exploitation others supporting still others benefiting even sake argument grant anarchist harsh moral condemnation capitalist society every type degree involvement justify use extreme violence giving system political support benefiting may morally objectionable surely enough make one liable blown piece another recent example provided osama bin laden in interview aftermath attack september said this preposterous understanding responsibility liability for claim american eligible killed maimed devising implementing america policy others participating political process still others paying tax even sake argument grant bin laden severe condemnation policy every type degree involvement justify use lethal violence surely voting election paying tax enough make one fair game attempt justification terrorism concede victim innocent seem promising they fall two group depending type ethical theory based adherent consequentialism judge terrorism like every practice solely consequence terrorism considered wrong bad consequence balance the innocence victim change this instance general trait consequentialism often highlighted critic example debate moral justification legal punishment a standard objection consequentialist approach punishment implies punishment innocent justified consequence good balance this objection get ground consequentialism denies matter person innocence morally significant those consider terrorism consequentialist point view differ assessment morality their judgment terrorism depends view good promoted use assessment utility terrorism mean promoting there room disagreement issue kai nielsen approach question political violence general terrorism particular consequentialist ethic socialist politics the use neither ruled categorically depends utility method attaining morally politically worthwhile objective truly socialist society liberation colonial rule when either employed tactical question must decided basis like choice weapon war nielsen nielsen wide definition terrorism example show innocence victim terrorism make difference conclusion apply terrorism wide narrow sense in view historical experience nielsen view tell u terrorism small scale used sole method struggle order provoke mass revolutionary action ineffective often counterproductive on hand terrorism employed conjunction guerrilla warfare protracted war liberation may well prove useful therefore also justified algeria south vietnam for earlier statement view see trotsky nicholas fotion also us wide definition terrorism he consequentialist although remark concerning innocence many victim terrorism might home nonconsequentialist ethic but find standard consequentialist assessment terrorism nielsen permissive if type terrorism justifiable certain circumstance circumstance extremely rare terrorist apologist perform requisite calculation properly one problem higher good promoted terrorism often defined ideological term rather derived settled preference interest actual people but part fotion discus issue mean if terrorist act campaign justified instrumentally must shown end sought good enough justify mean end indeed achieved mean terrorism end achieved way morally otherwise le costly terrorist matter fact fail discharge burden fotion argues regard terrorism victimizes innocent people discharged all direct victim terrorism treated object used terrorist but in reply terrorist claim advisedly sacrifice valued human being higher good but claim carry conviction would show alternative yet fotion argues always alternative taking opponent military establishment often also option going government official responsible wrong object instead attacking innocent person that kind terrorism may sometimes justified whereas terrorism target innocent people never within nonconsequentialist approach morality terrorism considered wrong rather insofar consequence bad balance but say approach leaf room whatever morally justifying certain act campaign terrorism indeed nonconsequentialist discussion terrorism also present range position argument a nonconsequentialist might try justify act campaign terrorism one two way one might invoke deontological consideration justice right favor resorting terrorism certain circumstance alternatively one might argue obvious obviously weighty consideration right victim terrorism justice demand respect right may sometimes overridden extremely weighty consideration extremely high price would paid resorting terrorism for rejection consequentialism course tantamount denying consequence action policy practice matter moral assessment denied consequentialists claim consequence matter virginia held operates broad notion terrorism justification terrorism meant apply terrorism target common citizen her discussion subject focus issue right when right person group respected may order ensure on one view known consequentialism right way ensure respect certain right a b infringe right c shall justified held hold right aim maximizing respect society appropriate yet right sometimes come conflict whether directly indirectly example when happens way avoid comparing right involved le stringent making certain choice that applies case terrorism terrorism obviously violates human right victim but advocate claim circumstance limited use terrorism way bringing society human right respected even claim true enough make resort terrorism justified but justified additional condition met distributive justice if society human right part population respected right another part population violated way changing ensuring human right respected limited use terrorism finally terrorism directed member first group privileged far respect human right terrorism morally justified this justification term distributive justice applied problem violation human right it equalize violation human right stage transition society right respected allow group already suffered violation human right suffer even violation assuming case dealing violation equally stringent human right human right many going violated case therefore morally preferable violation distributed equitable way held it might objected calling sacrificing basic human right right life bodily security individual victim terrorism sake distribution violation right within group course transition stage right respected throughout group held offends principle separateness person respect person primoratz in response held argues an argument achieving distribution right violation necessarily group argument right individual fairness held for objection held argument see steinhoff nath in held justification terrorism justice requires inescapable violation human right evenly distributed there different way allowing use terrorism certain circumstance within nonconsequentialist approach ethic violence it could argued far justice right concerned terrorism held terminology kind terrorism target innocent never justified furthermore consideration justice right carry much greater weight consideration good bad consequence therefore normally trump latter case conflict however exceptional circumstance consideration concerning price resorting extremely weighty override justice right michael walzer offer argument along line discussion terror bombing german city world war ii in early seemed britain would defeated germany military could prevail fighting accordance rule war britain remaining obstacle subjugation europe nazi that ultimate threat everything decent life ideology practice domination murderous degrading even might survive consequence final victory literally beyond calculation immeasurably awful walzer thus britain facing supreme emergency imminent threat b something utterly unthinkable moral point view in case dirty hand predicament often plague political action see walzer may breach basic weighty moral principle civilian immunity hope fending threat so three year raf later joined usaaf deliberately devastated many german city killed civilian seriously injured another attempt terrorize german people forcing leadership halt war surrender unconditionally by early clear germany going win war subsequent terror bombing lacked moral justification but first year walzer view terror bombing germany morally justified response supreme emergency britain facing walzer expands notion supreme emergency apply single political community facing threat extermination enslavement eventually single political community whose survival freedom stake for survival freedom political member share way life developed ancestor passed highest value international society walzer here two different conception supreme emergency the threat imminent nature threat differs one thing suffer fate nazi store people considered racially inferior another one polity dismantled by moving back forth two type supreme emergency ambiguous heading threat survival freedom political community walzer seek extend latter moral response might appropriate former yet whereas genocide expulsion enslavement entire people might thought moral disaster may fended mean loss political independence political disaster if polity dismantled lack moral legitimacy demise may well moral improvement but even polity moral legitimacy threat survival freedom fall short ultimate threat everything decent life if military justified waging war enemy civilian order defend there another le permissive position constructed along similar line based austere view count moral disaster might justify resort terrorism contrary many fighter social economic oppression colonial rule foreign occupation believe evil magnitude justify indiscriminate killing maiming innocent people extremely rare not every case oppression foreign rule occupation however morally indefensible amount moral disaster relevant sense nor every imminent threat survival freedom political community qualify contrary walzer argued however entire people subjected extermination attempt ethnically cleansing land facing true moral disaster may properly consider terrorism method struggle fate in view enormity finality extermination ethnic cleansing entire people constitute category apart to sure resorting terrorism case morally justified good ground believing terrorism succeed nothing else preventing imminent extermination ethnic cleansing stopping already way case condition met extremely rare indeed history may offer single example but mean act campaign terrorism could ever satisfy condition thus turn justified accordingly terrorism almost absolutely wrong primoratz chapter both supreme emergency moral disaster view justify resort terrorism way deal emergency prevent disaster respectively just certain must terrorism indeed achieve goal method one might argue extremis apply stringent epistemic standard deciding really know work must take chance might this walzer view predicament must wager crime terrorism evil otherwise store u there option risk otherwise great walzer it may objected position highlight enormity threat failing give due weight enormity mean proposed fending enormity terrorism deliberately killing maiming innocent people when taken account conclusion may rather even extremis terrorism justified reason believing work nothing else must strong indeed some hold terrorism absolutely wrong this position come different version some philosopher work wide definition terrorism argue certain circumstance selective terrorism target seriously implicated wrong issue may justified corlett young this seems suggest terrorism selective terrorism narrow never justified yet follow still room arguing terrorism latter type justified consideration supreme emergency moral disaster per bauhn leave he attempt show terrorism target common citizen never justified deploying slightly amended version alan gewirth ethical theory freedom safety fundamental prerequisite action therefore must accorded paramount weight the need protect generates range right right pertinent absolute right made intended victim homicidal project innocent person gewirth when absolute status right challenged invoking supreme emergency moral disaster bauhn argues moral difference positively directly causally responsible causally responsible indirectly failing prevent person intentionally bringing we morally responsible former except certain special circumstance latter if refuse resort terrorism order target innocent person thus fail prevent person perpetrating atrocity perpetrator morally responsible atrocity therefore must refuse bauhn chapter stephen nathanson seek ground absolute immunity civilian common citizen absolute prohibition terrorism entail ethical theory nathanson adopting civilian immunity rather adopting rule regulating matter rule best way reduce killing destruction armed conflict moreover best consequence achieved adopting absolute rule rather rule allowing exception supreme emergency the idea supreme emergency vague the criterion proffering supreme emergency exemption liable applied arbitrary subjective way finally slippery slope argument permitting departure rule civilian immunity including terrorism even direst circumstance lower bar justifying act broadcast message behavior may sometimes justified thus lend weight increasing use method nathanson however one adopt one ethical theory yet view immunity civilian common citizen attendant prohibition terrorism stringent absolute moral rule thus richard brandt brad hooker view immunity absolute they argue set moral rule selected good consequence adoption include rule allows indeed requires one prevent disaster even mean breaking moral rule even stringent moral rule prohibition deliberate use violence innocent people may overridden disaster prevented way grave enough see brandt hooker there thus convergence level practical conclusion understanding immunity civilian common citizen moral disaster position outlined thanks andrew alexandra tony coady thomas pogge helpful

wurde der entsprechende beschluss getroffen http zudem wann und wo konkret wurde der entsprechende beschluss veröffentlicht zur erklärung unserer motivation dafür da verfahren abzukürzen da glm wurde landtag für da pressegespräch benötigt da der lv über kein zugfahrzeug verfügt gab e die option entweder wieder ein fahrzeug mit den entsprechenden kosten anzumieten oder jemanden der über ein fahrzeug verfügt damit zu beauftragen daher erschien un die beauftragung de sv potsdam mit dem primären ansprechpartner basitan al die logische lösung wie au dem beschluss zu ersehen ist wird da glm

general this decision justified step transition green energy diesel vehicle comprise two third vehicle france diesel le expensive regular gas after decade political policy aimed pushing people buy car run diesel government decided diesel fuel longer therefore people must change car habit macron reduced tax income beginning administration taken step make wealthy pay transition ecologically sustainable technology even though wealthy one benefit profit generated ecologically harmful industrial activity consequently macron ecological argument gas tax largely ignored many people see decision increase tax gas yet another attack poor the french government responsible creating false dichotomy ecology need working people decade spatial planning concentrated economic activity job opportunity bigger metropolis developed public transportation area isolating rural area making car necessary large part population without option many people completely reliant car live work blocking

would surrounded contained protestors however official decision satisfy yellow vesters call circulated social medium the november demonstration paris failed reach objective presidential palace consequently yellow vesters converge paris decided repeat effort november so rather gathering base eiffel tower people converged blocked champ elysées target powerful symbolic status this luxurious avenue visited paris elysée palace president macron resides located end avenue a preceding week demonstrator tried get close presidential palace possible barricading confrontation took place day along parisian avenue it reported second round action gathered participant throughout france paris these figure suggest movement losing momentum in course demonstration paris people injured clash people arrested taken custody the first trial took place monday november bonfire champ elysées the yellow vest movement describes spontaneous horizontal without leader it difficult certain statement the movement started via social medium group facilitated decentralized action people decided locally wanted in regard clearly kind horizontal organizing going regarding whether movement truly leaderless complicated from beginning yellow vesters insisted movement apolitical leader instead supposed organic effort several group people working together basis shared anger nevertheless practically every

latter said answer eviction creating new national organization entitled le citron lemon continue fight tax rise took opportunity denounce lack democracy exists within yellow vest movement finally seems leaderless movement completely changed strategy aftermath second parisian demonstration on monday november list eight official spokesperson movement presented press apparently preceding day yellow vesters asked vote online elect new leading figure these nomination strategic decision already creating tension within movement some yellow vesters criticizing legitimacy election raising question leader got selected first place meanwhile member movement called another day action saturday december the demand clear more purchasing power the cancellation tax gas if demand granted demonstrator say march towards macron so far person announced participate event once unity watchword several week ago seems evaporated several local organizer dissociated movement opposition confrontational path movement seems taking a blockade night rather addressing question horizontality corporate medium outlet focusing another question protester anger legitimate many medium outlet suggested movement mostly composed undereducated people protecting environment describe demonstration violent order delegitimize anger participant despite medium outlet shifted discourse time becoming somewhat le condescending willing broadcast demonstrator concern for example confrontation champ elysées last saturday christophe castaner new minister interior said amount damage poor mostly material one important quite surprising statement considering corporate medium outlet politician decried similar action demonstration may day protest loi travail from perspective doubt anger legitimate most people take part movement speak difficult living situation deal every day it make sense saying enough gas issue straw broke camel back the population struggle harder harder survive everyone else remains comfortable enough affected economic shift tax increase targeting consumer for least so direct legitimate the question whether political vision value driving movement lead anything good eh let

demonstration paris debout soulève toi also chanted first verse marseillaise currently associated traditional republican party far right radical this chant could understood reference origin french revolution song coopted role french national anthem giving patriotic nationalist tone yellow bloc another example marching champ elysées crowd chanted we for reader statement seems innocuous enough affirmation demonstrator taken street author report framed however chant echo one regularly used national front supporter meeting understood context home sinister connotation for nationalist mean france always white christian nationalist country everyone fit identity political agenda therefore considered stranger intruder in word slogan creates narrative belongs the use word yellow vest demonstration poorly chosen ominous paris place reactionary tendency emerged movement indeed november cognac yellow vest protestors assaulted black woman driving car during altercation protestors told

montréal johanne savard présenté son rapport annuel mercredi photo martin chamberland la presse ajouter de la ville de montréal johanne savard beaucoup de réserves et se dit énormément préoccupée par la ligne antifraude annoncée il jours par le maire gérald tremblay il faut faire très attention de ne pa faire la promotion culture de suspicion et de délation ça nuit beaucoup à la qualité du milieu du travail déclaré mme savard en conférence de presse à de ville hier matin ce qui aussi avec de ligne de délation le risque de dénonciation malicieuse je serais très inquiète ligne anonyme ou qui précise avoir une longue expérience de relation de travail avant son arrivée à la ville se dit également inquiète de la confidentialité de information qui pourraient être obtenues grâce à cette ligne de dénonciation tant le dénonciateur que la personne accusée doivent être protégés si accuse et fin de compte ce pa fondé il ne faut pa avoir détruit sa réputation en cours de route il beaucoup de question et dans un tel projet mme savard croit que le récentes controverses qui ont éclaboussé de ville montrent que le mécanismes en place ont bien fonctionné si trouvée la fraude à si lit tout ce lit dans le journaux en de systèmes actuellement qui fonctionnent faut seulement le resserrer le rendre plus stricts mieux encadrés mais doit avoir une ligne de délation un petit peu de difficulté avec ça elle préconise une approche différente en vertu de laquelle le employés et le élus se verraient rappeler le règles auxquelles il sont assujettis il de reconfirmer le devoir de loyauté et le exigences le attentes raisonnables de la ville à cet égard et de intervient fait cette sortie en marge de la présentation de son rapport annuel le sixième depuis que la ville créé cette institution on constate une hausse de de plaintes en par rapport à précédente essentiellement à cause de la notoriété grandissante du bureau de de plaintes de toutes sortes déposées par le montréalais majorité ne correspondaient pa au mandat de et ont été refusées ou référées aux autorités municipales le bureau de finalement tenu enquêtes approfondies qui se sont toutes réglées à notre satisfaction note mme savard le plus frappant concerne une lacune du service de incendies de montréal qui empêchait de centaines de citoyens victimes incendie un remboursement de leurs assurance pour toutes sortes de raisons liées aux relation de travail expliqué mme savard le rapport pa remis aux citoyens or devaient obtenir ce document crucial pour le remettre à leurs assurance de centaines de victimes attendaient sans pouvoir finaliser leur dossier de auprès de la direction de incendies permis de régler administratif un nouveau type été créé explique mme savard on dit toujours que nous au bureau de de petits dossier et que le grand dossier vont au vérificateur général mais quand même parfois beaucoup sur le quotidien de gen le plateau dénoncé globalement johanne savard tenu à féliciter de la ville de montréal et de arrondissements pour leur collaboration à une seule exception près le plateau dans le faits difficile très difficile au plateau comme arracher une dent à chaque information il faut même vérifier le information nous donne elles sont parfois non conformes à la réalité elle affirme que la directrice de johanne falcon qui est au coeur du problème de employés auraient reçu la consigne de ne pa transmettre à auraient été semoncés après fait ai parlé à la mairesse de plusieurs fois même sonné la cloche auprès du directeur général de la ville avait de gross difficultés on est
